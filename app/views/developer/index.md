# Developer Documentation

## Overview

FootballOps.org uses a REST API and tries to remain as simple as possible to
allow users _and_ developers extract data, and create applications that are
beneficial to all users.

## Getting Started

FootballOps.org uses [OAuth 2](http://oauth.net/2) for authentication. In order
to begin using the API, you must register your app. This simply involves a name,
quick description, and a URI that we will redirect to after a successful
authentication request.

## Authentication

Get started reading about how to make authenticated requests in our
[authentication guide](/developer/authentication).

## REST API

FootballOps.org provides the following API endpoints for full access to the data
we store:

* [Users](/developer/users)
* [Schools](/developer/schools)
* [Conferences](/developer/conferences)
* [Districts](/developer/districts)
* [Divisions](/developer/divisions)
